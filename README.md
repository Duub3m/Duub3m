Hi there! 👋🏾
I'm a college student based in New York City with a passion for software engineering and community service. I’m actively seeking software engineering roles where I can leverage my skills to create impactful solutions. When I'm not coding, you'll find me participating in local initiatives, driven by my love for making a positive impact in my community.

Combining my technical skills with a dedication to service, I aim to create solutions that not only work but also benefit those around me.

What I'm Up To:
🌱 Currently learning C# mobile application frameworks to expand my skills in mobile app development.
📬 You can reach me at deneh03@gmail.com for any opportunities or collaborations.
👨🏾‍💻 Always looking for new ways to apply my software engineering skills in projects that make a difference.
